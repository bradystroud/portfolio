I am a software developer and [Certified Scrum Master](https://bcert.me/sgexulimx). 
Currently working as a consultant at [SSW](https://ssw.com.au/people/brady-stroud), I build full stack solutions for clients using a range of technologies.

My favourite tech at the moment:
 - .NET
 - Blazor
 - MAUI
 - Azure

When I'm not building cool stuff, I do downhill mountain biking, rock climbing or bouldering.
