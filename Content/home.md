I am a full stack developer working at [SSW](https://ssw.com.au/people/brady-stroud).

I am a [Certified Scrum Master](https://bcert.me/sgexulimx).
I worked on the new SSW Rules site using Gatsby, as well as the DevOps and cloud infrastructure of the project.  
Lately, I've been working with and learning Blazor for a client project. In the future, I want to dive into
cross-platform development using [MAUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui).

When I'm not building cool stuff, I do some downhill mountain biking and other outdoor activities.
