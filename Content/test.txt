I am a full stack web developer working at SSW. I like to work with .NET but also have experience with other development
frameworks including:

- Gatsby
- React
- Angular

I worked on the new SSW Rules site using Gatsby, as well as the DevOps and cloud infrastructure of the project.  
Lately, I have been working with and learning Blazor and .NET for a client project. In the future, I want to dive into
cross-platform development using [MAUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui).
